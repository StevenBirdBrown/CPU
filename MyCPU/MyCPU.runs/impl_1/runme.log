WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (CFGBVS-1) Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties - Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPIP-1) Input pipelining - DSP MyCPU/ALU/alu_out0 input MyCPU/ALU/alu_out0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPIP-1) Input pipelining - DSP MyCPU/ALU/alu_out0 input MyCPU/ALU/alu_out0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-1) PREG Output pipelining - DSP MyCPU/ALU/alu_out0 output MyCPU/ALU/alu_out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-2) MREG Output pipelining - DSP MyCPU/ALU/alu_out0 multiplier stage MyCPU/ALU/alu_out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net MyCPU/PC/pc_value_reg[5]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MyCPU/PC/pc_value_reg[5]_LDC_i_1/O, cell MyCPU/PC/pc_value_reg[5]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net MyCPU/PC/pc_value_reg[6]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MyCPU/PC/pc_value_reg[6]_LDC_i_1/O, cell MyCPU/PC/pc_value_reg[6]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clk1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin FSM_onehot_state_reg[8]_i_2/O, cell FSM_onehot_state_reg[8]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT FSM_onehot_state_reg[8]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 80 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    MyCPU/ALU/alu_out_reg[0] {FDRE}
    MyCPU/ALU/alu_out_reg[10] {FDRE}
    MyCPU/ALU/alu_out_reg[11] {FDRE}
    MyCPU/ALU/alu_out_reg[12] {FDRE}
    MyCPU/ALU/alu_out_reg[13] {FDRE}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (RTSTAT-10) No routable loads - 2 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are MyCPU/CU/io_reg_n_0_[0], MyCPU/CU/io_reg_n_0_[1].
